                Sea dragons are one of the world's most intricately disguised species. Sygnathidaes are boned with hard bodies and joined jaws. Seadragons have hard bone plates covering their scaleless body. They possesed a small head with a long, thin pipe like nose and a half length tail. From the head, body, and tail, elaborate leaf-like appendages sprout. They have small and transparent dorsal and pectoral fins, but no caudal or pelvic fins. Each bony plate has long, sharp spines that can be utilised to defend themselves. They are well outfitted to blend in with the seaweed and kelp formations they live amongst, as they have gossamer, leaf-shaped appendages all over their body. In their natural habitat, they resemble floating strands of seaweed, making them difficult to find for predators. They grow to be 35 centimetres in length.

                The leafy sea dragon can be seen on seagrass meadows, rocky reefs, seaweed beds, and sand areas near weed-covered reefs, where it seems to be drifting seaweed. This species have only been found along Australia's southern coast, from Jurien Bay Marine Park in Queensland to Wilsons Promontory in Victoria. The Ngari Capes Marine Park is where one can see the most leafy sea dragons in Western Australia, although you might also spot one at Shoalwater Islands Marine Park or Marmion Marine Park. the temperate waters of Australia are like home to these wonderfully camouflaged fishes, which belong to the same family as seahorses and pipefishes and the southern coast of Australia has been recorded for this species, from Kangaroo Island in South Australia to Rottnest Island in Western Australia. These fish live in depths, ranging from 3 to 50 metres on sand patches among kelp-covered rocks below the low tide line. They are particularly found on sand patches in waters up to <em>50 metres</em> (160 feet) deep, along kelp-covered rocks and sea grass clusters. people who does Scuba diving frequently see them in Adelaide, South Australia, specifically at Rapid Bay, Edithburgh, and Victor Harbor.

                 sea dragons do not have teeth and a stomach Because of which they consume practically continually while looking for prey over large regions. They eat mysid shrimp, as well as other small crustaceans, plankton, and larval fishes, which are one of thier favourite foods. They directly swallow their prey in one bite, using a joint on the lower half of their snout to produce suction kind of force to draw the food item into their little mouth. This feeding method is comparable to that of a pipette.

                The male leafy seadragon which looks similar to seahorses, looks after the eggs and plays important role in reproduction. The female lays up to 250 bright and pink eggs and uses her ovipositor which is a long tube, to deposit them on the male's tail. After that, the eggs attach themselves to a brood patch, which provides oxygen to them. Depending on the water conditions, the eggs begin to hatch approximately after 9 weeks. During this time, the eggs get turned into a ripe purple or orange colour thing and after that the male pumps his tail until the young emerge, this whole process takes 24â€“48 hours. By shaking his tail and rubbing it against seaweed and rocks, the male aids in the hatching of the eggs. The eggs are then carried from the female to the male's tail, where they are fertilised, however nothing is known about how this is done successfully. The average incubation time is four weeks, and hatching takes place over multiple days to maximise survival chances. A yolk sac provides nutrition for the first few days. Newborns are able to swim and hunt successfully shortly after birth. <i>P. eques</i> is around <em>20 mm</em> long when it is born and grows to <em>20 cm</em> in a year. The fish achieves adulthood between one and two years of age and can live for up to seven years in captivity. Much of the reproduction, such as the frequency of yearly breeding, is yet unclear or unknown.

                Leafies are fashioned in such a way that they blend in with the seaweed almost perfectly. The dorsal and pectoral fins  that are practically translucent, are used to guide and move these fishes. Leafy seadragons have a stiff outer skin that limits their flexibility and mobility. They are also known for staying in one place for long periods of time. When they move, though, they can reach speeds of about <em>150 metres</em> per hour.

                Many people have tried and got successful in capturing of this species, illegally for thier personal benefit such as they take them for their aquariums. In most of the cases, the people who captured these species, can not provide right amount and quality of food which results in death of such unique species. There are many other crucial problems to leafy Seadragons which are also life threatning such as loss in their seagrass habitat, high amount of pollution and excessive using of the fertiliser.
