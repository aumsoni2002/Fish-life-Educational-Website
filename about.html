    <p class="me">
        My name is Aum Amitkumar Soni, i am from india and i am 18 years old. I have completed my higher secondary
        education from Solaris Public School, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. Currently i am persuing my Advanced diploma in
        Computer Programming from Seneca College in Canada. In my leisure time, i love to play football or cricket with
        my friends, watch action/comedy films and series and spend a quality time with my family. I consider myself an
        extrovert because i love to meet new people and make new friends, i get excite everytime i meet strangers and
        talk with them. When i was in india and while doing my process for visa and collage, one thought always disturbs
        me that, will i able to make new friends their and will i able to talk to foreigners over thier, but it has
        become normal for me to talk to them. When i was young, i always wanted to make my career in football and always
        thought that i will be the team leader and loved to play at center forward position. But when i started growing
        up and became 16 or 17 years old, many prospects related to make career in football came into my mind such as it
        needs too much physical strength to archive a good career in any sports, there are millions of people who are
        working hard everyday to get one position in any big team and many more. So i dropped that idea and parallelly,
        i started getting interest in how people make this awesome websites and application. And after a deep research,
        i finally chose to become a computer programmer and will make my career in this field.
